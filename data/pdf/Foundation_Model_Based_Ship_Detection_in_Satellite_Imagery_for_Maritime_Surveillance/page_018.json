INTRODUCTION\ndiverse conditions, which a smaller supervised model trained from scratch might not\ncapture.\nThis work proposes to exploit foundation models for autonomous ship and mar-\nitime object detection in optical satellite imagery using PlanetScope images. We\nadopt a two-stage approach: first , an unsupervised pretrained of a large vision model\non abundant unannotated satellite (primarily PlanetScope data, with potential exten-\nsions to Sentinel-2 or SAR imagery), and second, a supervised fine-tuning of this model\non labeled examples of maritime targets. The goal is to transfer general learned fea-\ntures to the downstream task of ship detection, improving detection of small vessels\nacross variable environments while using only a modest amount of labeled data for\ntraining. This approach is developed as part of a research and development project\nat Indra Deimos - MARVISION. The MARVISION project has been awarded by\nthe Spanish Center for Technological Development and Innovation (CDTI),\nwith the Ministry of Defense as the end user through the General Directorate of\nArmament and Material (DGAM/PLATIN) , and funded with European funds\nfrom the Recovery and Resilience Mechanism (MRR) “Next Generation EU”.\nThe objective of this contract is the development of a prototype operational system\nfor maritime surveillance and its validation by the Ministry of Defense. This project\ncontributes to the Aerospace PERTE in its Action ACT9 – Spanish Earth Ob-\nservation System for Security and Defense, specifically addressing Technological\nChallenge No. 2. Indra Deimos, a Spanish company founded in 2001, employs ap-\nproximately 500 people across its subsidiaries in 5 European countries. The company\noperates within the sectors of space, defense, security, transportation, and informa-\ntion technologies. Indra Deimos is a recognized player in the space sector, actively\ninvolved across multiple domains, from space exploration and satellite navigation to\nlaunchers and space surveillance. However, its greatest expertise is notably in Earth\nObservation, including the development of satellites and their ground segments, as well\nas satellite-based applications.\nThe project is integrated into a full processing pipeline - from raw image acquisition\nand preprocessing, through detection and identification of ships, to the generation of\noutputs or alerts for end-users. By training a foundation model on broad satellite\nimagery and specializing it for the maritime domain, we aim to advance the state of\nthe art in satellite-based ship detection, achieving higher accuracy and generalization\nthan conventional methods.\n1.2 Objectives\nThis project explores the feasibility of training a Foundation Model in an unsupervised\nmanner as an initial step to later develop specific detection functions using the learned\nlatent space. The objective is to improve the detection model’s learning efficiency,\nreducing the need for large amounts of labeled data.\nOnce trained, the model will be integrated into a fully operational processing\npipeline, covering the entire workflow from image acquisition to object detection and\nresult delivery.\nThe specific objectives of this project are:\n• Data Preparation and Management: Preprocess satellite imagery (Plan-\netScope mainly) for ingestion into the foundation model and manually annotate",
