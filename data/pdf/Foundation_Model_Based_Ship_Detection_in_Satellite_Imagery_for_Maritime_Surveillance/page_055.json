FINE-TUNING FOR SHIP DETECTION 39\n(a) Typical test patch\n(epoch 131)\n(b) Late validation (epoch\n193)\n(c) Early validation (epoch\n32)\nFigure 4.6: Qualitative segmentation examples for the fine-tuned BCE + IoU model.\nEach strip displays the masked RGB input, ground-truth mask, and model prediction\n(left − →right). From early to late epochs the network eliminates most false positives\nand recovers small vessels, converging to the behavior quantified in Table 4.2.\nwake are slightly over-dilated ( ∼1 px), consistent with the systematic “larger-\nthan-label” tendency noted earlier. No spurious pixels appear elsewhere in the\npatch.\n• Panel (b) – Late-epoch validation montage (epoch 193). Rows 1 & 2\nshow multiple small craft scattered across open sea; all targets are recovered,\nalthough one tiny boat ( row 2 ) is missed (FN) and a distant wake fragment\ntriggers a 3-px false alarm. Row 3 depicts a tight cluster of pleasure boats near\na buoy line: nine of ten hulls are delineated, confirming that the model can cope\nwith dense scenes. The remaining rows include a specular sun-glint on a pier\nedge and a faint diagonal wake; both are correctly ignored, indicating that the\nIoU regulariser curbs over-segmentation on linear features.\n• Panel (c) – Early-epoch validation montage (epoch 32). Before the\nIoU term stabilizes, the model alternates between under-segmentation ( rows 1\n& 3 : long wakes broken into fragments) and aggressive over-segmentation ( row\n2: cloud edge misclassified as a vessel). By epoch 131 these errors vanish, high-\nlighting the importance of sufficient training iterations despite the apparently\nnoisy BCE component in Figure 4.4.\nIn summary, the qualitative results corroborate the quantitative gains reported\nin Section 4.2.2: once converged, the BCE + IoU model reliably detects vessels of\n2–3 px upwards, maintains low false-positive rates in cluttered coastal environments,\nand only marginally overestimates hull extents—an acceptable bias in maritime-safety\napplications where missing a vessel is costlier than trimming a few pixels of water.",
