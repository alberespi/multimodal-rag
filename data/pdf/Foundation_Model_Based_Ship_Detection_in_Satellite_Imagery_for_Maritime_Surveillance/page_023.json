Another work designed a custom YOLOv7-\nbased model with spatial pyramid clustering and shuffle attention to better detect\nmultiscale ships in complex scenes, and reported improved accuracy in high-resolution\nship image datasets (HRSID) [12]. CNN-based detectors have also been combined with\ntracking algorithms (e.g., DeepSORT) to improve detection consistency in time-series\nimagery [13]. Beyond CNNs, transformer-based detectors are emerging: for instance,\nthe DETR model (Detection Transformer) pre-trained on large datasets was adapted\nfor ship detection on the SeaShips dataset [14], showing that transformers can serve as\npowerful backbones for maritime object detection as well.\nSeveral enhancements have been introduced to tailor deep detector to the maritime\ndomain. Multi-scale feature fusion (e.g., Feature Pyramid Networks) is commonly used\nto detect both small boats and large vessel in the same image [15, 16, 17, 18]. Atten-\ntion mechanisms (spatial or channel attention) help the network focus on ship targets\nagainst complicated ocean textures [19, 20]. Data augmentation (varying brightness,\nadding noise, flipping, etc.) is employed to simulate different imaging conditions and\nmake models more robust. Despite their high accuracy, deep learning models have\nknown limitations. They are data-hungry - training a high-capacity model requires a\nsufficiently large and representative training set of labeled ship images. If the training\ndata lacks diversity (for example, only ports but no open ocean, or only calm seas),\nthe model may not generalize well to new scenarios [9]. Deep models also tend to\ntreat each pixel grid independently, so they can be fooled by look-alikes (e.g., a clus-\nter of waves or clouds might resemble a ship). Researchers address these issues with\ntechniques like hard negative mining (explicitly training on false alarm cases) [21, 22]\nor domain adaptation (adapting a model trained on one distribution, say simulated\ndata or one sensor type, to another.) Indeed, unsupervised domain-adaptive training\nhas been proposed to handle distributions shifts between different satellite sensors or\nimaging conditions [23]. Overall, deep learning currently offers the best raw detection\nperformance and has become the de facto approach in most recent vessel detection\nstudies.\n2.1.3 Hybrid & Specialized Techniques\nSome approaches combine classical and deep methods to leverage the advantages of\nboth. For example, a CFAR algorithm might first rapidly scan a SAR image to propose\ncandidate ship pixels, and then a CNN refines those candidates to confirm actual vessels\n(reducing false alarms) [9, 24]. This can dramatically cut computation by avoiding a\nfull image deep scan while still improving accuracy. Other hybrid strategies include\nintegrating auxiliary data - notably Automatic Identification System ( AIS) signals -\nwith image detection. Operational systems often correlate satellite detectors with AIS\ntransponder data to validate known vessels and flag “dark” (AIS-silent) targets [25].\nIn research, AIS data (which provides vessel locations) has been used as a form of weak\nlabel to train detectors without manual annotation: if an AIS signal indicates a ship at\na location the image patch is assumed to contain a vessel for training purposes. This\nweakly supervised approach can generate large training sets, though it may introduce\nnoise (e.g., AIS might be present but the ship is visually obscured).\nAnother line of work is fully unsupervised vessel detection - treating ship\nspotting as an anomaly detection problem. Here, one might model the normal back-\nground (open water) and detect vessels as outliers without any labeled examples. A",
