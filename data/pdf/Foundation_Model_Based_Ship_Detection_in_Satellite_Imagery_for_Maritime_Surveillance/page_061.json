ERROR ANALYSIS AND MODEL LIMITATIONS 45\nmaritime scenes but was used mainly for classification; a U-Net model fine-tuned on\nHRSC2016 is expected to attain high pixel-level accuracy (no official IoU reported). For\ncontext, combining MASATI and HRSC2016 in a detection task yielded F1≈94.5% [70].\nUOW-Vessel (2024): a new large-scale instance segmentation benchmark [56]. Base-\nline results show the best model (YOLOv8-L) obtainsmAP ≈ 61.7% for instance masks\n(averaged over IoU=0.5:0.95) and mAP0.5 ≈ 80% [56]. This implies many ships are\ndetected with IoU > 0.5, though the overall instance IoU average has room for improve-\nment. In summary, our thesis’s primary metric – instance-wise IoU – is not uniformly\nreported in prior works, but their results (especially the high F2 and mAP scores) indi-\ncate that state-of-the-art methods can achieve a high detection/segmentation quality of\nships (roughly 80–90% overlap on average) under favorable conditions. The differences\nin evaluation (instance vs. pixel IoU, F2 vs. mAP) highlight the need to carefully align\nmetrics when comparing models in this domain.\n5.3 Error Analysis and Model Limitations\nFigure 5.1 shows three typical failure modes of the ship-detection network:\n• False negatives on small or specular targets(panel a). Tiny vessels or those\ndominated by a specular highlight are sometimes ignored, yielding an FN and\nlowering the instance-wise IoU. This behavior is consistent with the instance-level\nconfusion matrix in Fig. 4.5, where 27 of 97 vessels are missed.\n• False positives caused by wakes, coastline texture and thin clouds(panel\nb). High-frequency patterns that resemble elongated hulls are incorrectly seg-\nmented. Many of these artifacts are removed by the min size = 2 px filter, yet\nlarger blobs survive and reduce precision.\n• Unstable predictions in early epochs (panel c). During the first ≈30 epochs\nthe model produces scattered, elongated detections; after the BCE + IoU loss\n“warms up”, these artifacts disappear, but slight over-segmentation persists through-\nout training.\nAcross all failure cases, predicted masks are ≈10–35% larger than the ground-truth\nshapes. This systematic bias is expected: with a class imbalance of roughly 1 : 1800\n(vessel : water pixels), the BCE + IoU loss rewards over-coverage more than under-\ncoverage. The effect increases recall—desirable for maritime safety—but penalizes the\nstrict instance-IoU metric used in this thesis.\nRoot causes\n• Extreme class imbalance ( ≈5000 vessel pixels vs. 4.6 M water pixels in the test\nsubset).\n• Post-processing thresholds (IoU thr = 0.2, min size = 2 px) tuned on BCE-only\nexperiments, not re-optimized for the final BCE + IoU model.\n• No geometric or radiometric augmentation during fine-tuning,\n• Geographic bias: all training imagery comes from the Western Mediterranean;\ndifferent coastal morphologies may trigger unseen error modes elsewhere.",
