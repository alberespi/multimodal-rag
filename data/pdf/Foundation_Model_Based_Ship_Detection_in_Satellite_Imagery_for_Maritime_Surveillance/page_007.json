  "text": "Abstract\nThis thesis addresses automatic ship detection in medium-resolution satellite imagery\n(PlanetScope, 3 m) through a foundation-model approach. The proposed pipeline\nconsists of two stages: (i) large-scale self-supervised pre-training of an enhanced U-Net\non ∼60 000 unlabeled six-band patches; and (ii) supervised fine-tuning with only 280\nlabeled vessel-containing patches. The goal is to drastically reduce annotation cost\nwhile achieving operational-grade accuracy for maritime-surveillance applications.\nDuring pre-training, the network learns robust representations by reconstructing\nrandomly masked regions. Fine-tuning employs a hybrid BCE + IoU loss, tailored to\nsmall objects and severe class imbalance (water≫ vessel). The resulting model delivers\nan instance-wise IoU of 0.536 and an instance F1-score of 0.671, lowering false\npositives to 0.04% of water pixels and having a low error rate in detection. Compared\nwith the best baseline trained from scratch, this corresponds to gains of +0.155 IoU\nand +0.309 F1.\nThe methodology is deployed within MARVISION, a CDTI-funded project sup-\nported by Next Generation EU funds and validated by the Spanish Ministry of Defense.\nBatch inference processes ≈16 six-band patches per 50 ms on a single NVIDIA A40\nGPU, fulfilling near-real-time requirements of the MARVISION processing chain. The\nstudy demonstrates that foundation models enable reliable ship segmentation with an\norder-of-magnitude fewer labels and establishes a basis for forthcoming multi-resolution\nand multi-sensor extensions.\nKeywords\nfoundation models, self-supervised learning, ship detection, PlanetScope, semantic seg-\nmentation, maritime surveillance\niii",
