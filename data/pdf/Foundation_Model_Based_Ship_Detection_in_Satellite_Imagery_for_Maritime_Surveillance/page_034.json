RELATED WORK\nwhen the detection models are both accurate and efficient (which foundation models\ncan facilitate by enabling use of smaller fine-tuned models without losing accuracy).\nAdditionally, the scope of detection will broaden. Instead of just finding whether a\nvessel is present, systems will also recognize vessel types, activities (e.g., transshipment\nat sea, formation patterns), and anomalies (a ship that deviates from normal routes\nor behaves erratically). These higher-level capabilities can be achieved by building on\nthe rich representations of foundation models and training them for tasks beyond just\ndetection.\nIn conclusion, the state-of-the-art in vessel detection has reached a point where\noperational use of AI is reality, and the incorporation of foundation models is set\nto push it even further. By overcoming data limitations and improving adaptability,\nfoundation model-based approaches will likely become the cornerstone of maritime\nAI systems. Researchers will focus on refining these models, addressing any remaining\nshortcomings (such as interpretability and trustworthiness of the AI decisions), and\nintegrating them seamlessly with existing surveillance infrastructure. The outcome\nwill be more secure and well-monitored seas, where illicit or dangerous activities can\nbe detected early and accurately through the collaborative efforts of advanced AI and\nhuman oversight.",
