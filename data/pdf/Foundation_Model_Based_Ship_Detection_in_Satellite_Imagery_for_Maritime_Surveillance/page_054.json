EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS\n(a) Pixel-wise confusion matrix\n (b) Instance-wise confusion matrix\nFigure 4.5: Error distribution for the best fine-tuned model (IoU thr = 0.20, min size\n= 2 px). Pixel-wise FP rate is low (376 / 917 000), while instance detection misses 27\nvessels and produces 21 spurious candidates.\n2. Recall-oriented losses trade precision for sensitivity. BCEDice and Focal-\nBCE boost recall (>0.63) but at the cost of doubling false positives, which drops\npixel precision to ∼0.30. In maritime monitoring, where every false alarm trig-\ngers an operator review, the hybrid loss achieves a healthier balance (precision\n0.57, recall 0.49).\n3. Nominal loss value is a weak proxy for IoU. During training the BCE +\nIoU run maintains a validation loss around 0.7 (Figure 4.4)—higher than several\nalternative losses that nevertheless end up with lower IoU. This confirms the\nearlier observation (Section 4.1) that, in highly-imbalanced settings, absolute\nBCE magnitude is poorly correlated with segmentation quality. A loss that\nembeds the evaluation criterion (IoU) guides the network towards masks that\nlook worse in raw BCE units yet score better where it matters operationally.\nPractical Takeaway:\nDespite similar architecture, optimizer and data, the choice of loss alone yields a +11\npercentage-point gain in instance IoU and reduces spurious detections from 46 − →21\n(Figure 4.5). Consequently, the rest of this chapter and the real-time prototype de-\nployed in MARVISION adopt BCE + IoU as the default objective.\n4.2.4 Qualitative Segmentation Results\nFigure 4.6 illustrates how the fine-tuned model evolves from the early stages of training\nto its final checkpoint, using the standard three-column layout: left – PlanetScope\nRGB patch, center – ground-truth mask (water = blue, vessel = green), right –\nmodel prediction.\n• Panel (a) – Test patch (epoch 131, checkpoint used for evaluation).
