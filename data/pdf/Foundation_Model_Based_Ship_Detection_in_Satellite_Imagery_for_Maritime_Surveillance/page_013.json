(b) MSELoss –\nsea & coastline: rows 1 and 5 depict shoreline fragments, while rows 2–4\nshow open ocean. (c) MSELoss – sea & vessel: row 1 contains a small\nbright vessel; rows 2–5 are homogeneous sea surface. (d) MSELoss – ur-\nban patterns & mixed scenes: row 3 highlights a regular grid of coastal\nbuildings, and row 4 a bright shoreline road network.
