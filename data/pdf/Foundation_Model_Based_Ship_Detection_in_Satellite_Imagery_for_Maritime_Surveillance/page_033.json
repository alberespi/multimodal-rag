Future vessel detectors\nbuilt on foundation models are expected to be more resilient to distribution shifts\n- for example, a foundation-model-based detector might handle a sudden change in\nimage quality or an unseen environmental condition more gracefully, having effectively\n“seen” something similar in its vast pre-training experience [8]. This will be crucial\nfor building truly global maritime monitoring capabilities that work 24/7 under all\nweather. Early evidence of this is seen in research where self-supervised pre-trained led\nto more robust ship detection detection in stormy weather images than a conventionally\ntrained model [8].\n2.4.3 Future Research Directions\nBuilding on current progress, several directions appear promising, One is the devel-\nopment of multi-model foundation models for maritime surveillance . This involves\ncombining data streams - for instance, training a model on satellite imagery together\nwith AIS data, ship logs or radar data - so that the model learns the correlation be-\ntween visual cues and other information. A vision-language foundation model that\nunderstands a sentence like “a tanker near port with oil slick” and associates it with\nsatellite imagery could enable powerful query-based surveillance (e.g., ask the model\nto find “possible oil-smuggling vessels” in imagery). Some recent work has already\ndemonstrated unsupervised vision-language alignment in remote sensing [33], which\ncould be extended to maritime scenarios.\nAnother direction is real-time adaptable models. Rather than training a static model\nand deploying it, future systems might employ models that continue to learn on the fly\nin an unsupervised manner. A satellite imaging a new region could use self-supervised\nlearning to adjust its vessel detection model to local background characteristics with-\nout explicit labels. This concept of continuous learning or life-long learning will\nleverage foundation model architectures that can be updated with new data streams.\nIt could help address the issue of domain shift continuously (for example, a model\nthat gradually adapts from summer imagery to monsoon-season imagery as the year\nprogresses, without needing a full retraining).\nOn the algorithmic front, there is interest in bridging the gap between fully super-\nvised detectors and unsupervised anomaly detectors, Semi-supervised learning methods\n- where a small labeled set and a large unlabeled set are used together - could dra-\nmatically increase detection performance when annotated data is scarce. Foundation\nmodels provide one way to do this (by pre-training on the unlabeled set), but other\ntechniques like teacher-students self-training ir active learning (where the model identi-\nfies uncertain detections for human to label) can be incorporated into future workflows.\n2.4.4 Expected Impact on Maritime Surveillance Systems\nAs foundation model techniques mature, we expect next-generation maritime surveil-\nlance systems to be far more autonomous, scalable and intelligent . The de-\npendency on human analyst for constant monitoring will lessen as detectors become\nmore reliable with fewer false alarms. Analysts will instead focus on reviewing high-\nconfidence alerts or handling the integration of multi-source data, with AI handling\nthe grunt work of scanning thousands of images. Large-scale monitoring - for example,\ntracking every vessel above a certain size across all oceans - becomes more feasible",
