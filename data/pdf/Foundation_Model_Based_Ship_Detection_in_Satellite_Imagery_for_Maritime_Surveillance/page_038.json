We leveraged these to ensure that\nwhen we rasterized ship polygons, we used the correct transform and shape matching\nthe image patch, producing an accurate label mask. In summary, Rasterio allowed us\nto treat satellite imagery as just arrays (for normalization, tiling, etc.) while preserv-\ning the georeferencing under the hood – a vital capability when aligning ground-truth\nvectors with imagery. This brief introduction is provided as many deep learning practi-\ntioners may be unfamiliar with satellite-specific libraries; in essence, Rasterio simplifies\nremote sensing data handling by exposing it in a scientist-friendly manner (NumPy ar-\nrays and GeoJSON interoperable) [63].\n3.2 Model Architecture & Self-Supervised Pretrain-\ning\n3.2.1 U-Net Architecture (Residual Encoder-Decoder)\nThe architecture of the segmentation model is based on the well-known U-Net con-\nvolutional network. In particular, we employ an enhanced version of the U-Net\nmodel used in the PhilEO benchmark [64], which retains the fundamental en-\ncoder–decoder structure characteristic of U-Net. This means the network has a con-\ntracting path that captures multi-scale features and an expanding path that enables\nprecise spatial reconstruction of the segmentation map. U-Net architectures are a pop-\nular choice for semantic segmentation in Earth observation tasks [64], and by building\non this foundation we ensure the model benefits from proven design principles while\nadapting it to our specific needs.\nSeveral structural adaptations have been introduced to the baseline U-Net with\nthe goal of improving feature extraction capacityin the context of large-scale pre-\ntraining and the target task of ship segmentation. These architectural modifications\n(omitted here for confidentiality) strengthen the network’s ability to learn rich and\ndiscriminative representations from satellite imagery. In practice, the improved design\nallows the model to better capture subtle details of ships and robustly integrate con-\ntextual information across different scales, which is crucial for accurate segmentation.\nBy leveraging the strengths of the original U-Net and carefully refining its components,\nthe resulting model is better tailored to the maritime domain and pretraining scenario,\nultimately achieving superior performance on ship segmentation tasks compared to the\nstandard U-Net baseline [64].\nFigure 3.2 provides a generic schematic of the original U-Net architecture intro-\nduced by Ronneberger et al. (2015) [1]. Although our implementation incorporates\nproprietary adaptations, the high-level encoder–decoder structure with symmetric skip\nconnections remains conceptually similar.\n3.2.2 Self-Supervised Pretraining Procedure\nDuring the self-supervised pretraining stage, we trained the U-Net model on a large set\nof unlabeled PlanetScope image patches, using a masked reconstruction objective as\ndescribed above. To improve the model’s robustness and encourage it to learn gener-\nalizable features, we applied data augmentation to the input patches in this phase. In",
