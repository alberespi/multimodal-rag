  "text": "4.2. FINE-TUNING FOR SHIP DETECTION 37\n4.2.2 Quantitative Detection Performance (Pixel & Instance)\nTable 4.2 compares the five loss-function variants evaluated during fine-tuning. Metrics\nare computed on the held-out test set using anIoU threshold of 0.20and min size =\n2 px for instance matching. All experiments share identical hyper-parameters (Adam,\nLR = 1 × 10−4, batch 16, 200 epochs, no data augmentation). The BCE + IoU\ncomposite loss clearly outperforms the alternatives in both pixel-wise and instance-\nwise scores.\nTable 4.2: Pixel-wise and instance-wise test metrics (best checkpoint per loss).\nLoss Pixel level Instance level\nP R F1 IoU P R F1 IoU\nBCE+IoU 0.571 0.486 0.525 0.356 0.645 0.700 0.671 0.536\nBCEDice 0.285 0.662 0.399 0.249 0.361 0.629 0.458 0.530\nFocalBCE 0.302 0.650 0.412 0.260 0.427 0.671 0.522 0.452\nFocalTversky 0.508 0.350 0.414 0.261 0.541 0.571 0.556 0.447\nBCEWithLogits 0.178 0.781 0.289 0.169 0.270 0.547 0.362 0.381\nKey Observations:\n• BCE + IoU boosts pixel IoU to 0.356 (≈ +42% relative to the next best, 0.25\n– 0.26) and lifts instance F1 to 0.671, a gain of 28 points over plain BCEWith-\nLogits.\n• Losses optimized only for regional agreement (e.g. BCEDice, FocalBCE) improve\nrecall but suffer from low precision (many false positives).\n• Focal Tversky balances classes better than Focal BCE, yet still trails the com-\nposite BCE + IoU by >11 points in instance IoU.\nThe confusion matrices for the best checkpoint (epoch 131) further illustrate\nthis behavior. Pixel-wise, only 376 water pixels are wrongly classified as vessels (FP),\nwhile 530 vessel pixels are missed (FN), yielding a balanced precision–recall trade-\noff. At instance level, 4 9 vessels are correctly detected, 27 are missed and 21\nspurious detections appear (Figure 4.5). This confirms that the model errs on the\nside of slight under-segmentation rather than over-reporting, a desirable property in\nmaritime surveillance scenarios where false alarms are costly.\nOverall, BCE + IoU delivers the most favorable trade-off between detection sensi-\ntivity and false-alarm control, validating the choice of a hybrid regional loss for highly-\nimbalanced, small-object satellite segmentation tasks.\n4.2.3 Loss-Function Ablation and Key Findings\nTable 4.2 reveals three clear trends:\n1. Hybrid regional terms outperform pure BCE or focal variants. Adding\nthe soft-IoU component to BCE (row BCE + IoU ) increases pixel-level IoU by\n+42% over the next best loss (0.356 vs ≈ 0.25) and raises instance F1 from the\nmid-0.5s to 0.67. The improvement stems from explicitly optimizing overlap: the\nIoU term rewards masks that best match the ground-truth footprint, whereas\nBCE alone is agnostic to shape once pixels are classified correctly.",
