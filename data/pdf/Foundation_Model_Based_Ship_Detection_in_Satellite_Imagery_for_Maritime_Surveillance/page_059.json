Two questions guide the discussion:(i)\nwhat tangible benefits do the self-supervised pre-training and subsequent fine-tuning\nprovide over purely supervised baselines? and (ii) how robust and deployable is the\nresulting ship-detection model for real-world maritime-surveillance workflows? The sec-\ntions that follow synthesize the quantitative evidence, examine remaining limitations,\nand reflect on practical implications for AIS correlation and near-real-time alerting.\n5.1 Principal Findings\nHigh downstream accuracy with minimal labels\nUsing only 280 labeled patches (≈ 5 000 vessel pixels vs 4.6 M water pixels) the fine-\ntuned model attains Instance IoU = 0.536 and Instance F1 = 0.671 —figures on\na par with studies that require thousands of manual annotations. The self-supervised\nencoder learnt in Phase 1 supplies rich features that converge within 200 epochs, con-\nfirming that foundation-style pre-training slashes annotation cost while pre-\nserving instance-level accuracy.\nIoU-centered objective is critical for detecting whole vessels\nSwitching from a pure BCE objective to the hybrid BCE + IoU raises Instance IoU\nby +0.155 (from 0.381 − →0.536) and Instance F1 by +0.309(0.362 − →0.671), while\ncutting false positives from 46 to 21. This underscores that, for tiny maritime targets,\noptimizing instance overlap directly matters more than reducing pixel-wise\nerror.\nSix-band input mitigates spectral confusion\nQualitative results (Fig. 4.6) show improved separation of wakes, cloud streaks, and\ncoastline when Red-Edge & NIR bands are included—an advantage absent in RGB-only\nvariants.\nRobust operating window for matching parameters\nEarly sensitivity testing (Table 4.3) revealed that varyingIoU thr from 0.20 to 0.25 and\nmin size from 2 to 4 px alters Instance F1 by less than ±2 pp. The deployment\n43",
