Community benchmarks (leaderboards, challenges) have been key in\npushing the state-of-the-art by providing a common reference for comparison.\n2.4 Conclusions & Future Directions\n2.4.1 Summary of Findings\nThe state-of-the-art in vessel detection from satellite imagery has advanced signifi-\ncantly, achieving capabilities that were unattainable with older methods. Deep learning\ndetectors now form the backbone of most high-performance systems, demonstrating\nexcellent accuracy in both optical and SAR imagery for vessel localization. Tech-\nniques like YOLO, Faster R-CNN and transformer-based models have been tailored to\nmaritime scenarios with specialized modules for small object detection and complex\nbackground suppression. These methods dramatically outperform classical techniques\n(like CFAR or simple image processing), especially in challenging environments (rough\nseas, cluttered coastlines, low-contrast targets). At the same time, we identified gaps\nand limitations that persist. Chief among them is the dependence on large labeled\ndatasets - a barrier in a domain where labeling is difficult. Many current model struggle\nto generalize beyond the conditions they were trained on. For instance, a model trained\non a calm Atlantic water may stumble when faced with SAR images of the polar seas or\nan optical image taken under different illumination. False positives remain an issue, as\nalgorithms can still confuse unusual robustness. Moreover, deploying these advanced\nmodels in real operational pipelines (with strict real-time and reliability requirements)\nis non-trivial due to computational demands and the need for validation for results\n(analysts often require high confidence in alerts).\n2.4.2 The Role & Impact of Foundation Models\nFoundation models have emerged as promising avenue to address some of these chal-\nlenges. By leveraging unsupervised learning at scale, they reduce the need for labeled\ndata and provide a strong starting point for many tasks. In the context of maritime\nvessel detection, foundation models are expected to significantly impact future systems\nin several ways. First, their use will likely reduce the training data bottleneck -\ninstead of requiring thousands of annotated images for a new satellite or scenario, a\npre-trained foundation model can be fine-tuned with a few dozen examples, making it\nfeasible to develop detectors for niche scenarios (e.g., specific coastal region or a new\nsatellite sensor) quickly and with lower cost. Second, foundation models trained on\ndiverse data can serve as a universal backbone for maritime vision tasks. We can\nenvision a single large model that has ingested multi-spectral satellite imagery, aerial\nimagery, perhaps even ship photographs and AIS text descriptions to build a holistic\nrepresentations of vessels. Such a model could be adapted not only to detect ships, but\nalso to classify types, segment their outline or even predict their intents, all with minor\ntask-specific tuning. This cross-task adaptability would streamline the development\nof comprehensive maritime surveillance systems (detection, identification, tracking all\nusing the same core model).\nAnother advantage is improved generalization and robustness . Foundation\nmodels, by virtue of being trained on “everything”, tend to capture features that",
