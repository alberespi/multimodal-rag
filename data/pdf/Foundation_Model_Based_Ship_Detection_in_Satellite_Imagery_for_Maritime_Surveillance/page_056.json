EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS\nFailure modes and training dynamics.\nDuring the first 20–30 epochs the network oscillates between two extremes: it either\npredicts all–water masks (class–imbalance bias) or generates salt–and–pepper artifacts\naround high-frequency textures such as cloud edges or ship wakes (Fig. 4.6 (c) row 2).\nThis transient phase explains the comparatively high BCE component in Fig. 4.4: BCE\npunishes every mis-labeled water pixel, whereas the IoU term is insensitive until the\nfirst coherent vessel blob appears. Once the IoU gradient becomes dominant (after\nepoch ∼30) the model rapidly converges to the patterns shown in panels (a)–(b).\nResidual errors at the best checkpoint (epoch 131) fall into four categories:\n1. Hull dilation : correct vessels predicted ∼1–2 px larger than the label ( panel\na); acceptable in maritime–surveillance contexts where misses are costlier than\nslight over-segmentation.\n2. Wake fragments: long, linear wakes occasionally segmented as vessels (panel c,\nrow 1); mitigated in practice by a minimum-extent filter during post-processing.\n3. Specular or cloud glint FP : specular highlights near the shore are sometimes\nmis-classified early in training but disappear by epoch ≳100 (panel b, row 1).\n4. Micro FN: boats smaller than 3 px can be missed when contrast is poor (panel\nb, row 2, rightmost craft); pushing min size below 2 increases recall but doubles\nFP, so the current setting is retained.\nThese observations reinforce the quantitative conclusion of Section 4.2.2: although\nthe final BCE is higher than in other loss variants, the BCE + IoU objective yields\nmasks with better geometric fidelity and a lower operational false-alarm rate.\n4.3 Summary of Results and Early-Stage Sensitiv-\nity Analysis\nThis section consolidates the findings of Chapter 4 and summarizes a preliminary\nsensitivity study carried out in the exploratory stage of the project. Before the\nBCE + IoU loss was adopted, we used a BCEWithLogits baseline to gauge how the\nmatching parameters—the IoU threshold (IoU thr) and the minimum instance size\n(min size)—influence the evaluation metrics. Although the absolute scores of that\nbaseline are lower than those of the final model, the trends observed remain informa-\ntive and guided the configuration ultimately deployed.\n4.3.1 Key Numbers at a Glance\n• Best fine-tuned model (BCE + IoU, epoch 131)\nP ixel IoU= 0 .356, P ixel F1 = 0 .525, Instance IoU= 0 .536, Instance F1 = 0 .671\n• Pixel false-positive rate: 0.04%.\n• Good overall performance instance-wise taking into account that small boats are\nnot labeled in the ground truth and the model gets to detect them nevertheless\n(21 spurious vessels as seen in Fig. 4.5)",
