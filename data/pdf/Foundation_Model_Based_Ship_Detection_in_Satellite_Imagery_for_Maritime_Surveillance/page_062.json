DISCUSSION & EVALUATION\n(a) BCE+IoU – false\nnegatives and wake over-\nsegmentation\n(b) Focal BCE – false posi-\ntives on wake/coast\n(c) Early epoch output –\nnoisy elongated masks\nFigure 5.1: Typical failure modes on held-out validation patches. Each triplet displays,\nfrom left to right, the RGB input, ground-truth mask, and model prediction.\nMitigation strategies\n• Replace the BCE component with a class-balanced or focal variant and re-\noptimize post-processing thresholds with Bayesian search.\n• Introduce synthetic wakes and random rotations during augmentation to reduce\norientation bias.\n• Expand the training set to Atlantic and Indo-Pacific scenes, then apply lightweight\ndomain adaptation.\n• Deploy a confidence-aware alerting pipeline in which detections below an IoU-\nproxy score of 0.25 are sent to a human operator for validation.\n5.4 Summary of Findings\nThe experimental evidence gathered in Chapter 4 and the error analysis of Section 5.3\nlead to four main insights:\n1. Label efficiency. With only 280 vessel–containing patches the MAE-initialized\nU-Net reaches Instance IoU = 0.536 and Instance F1 = 0.671 , showing that a\nfoundation-model strategy can cut the annotation effort by an order of magnitude\ncompared with fully supervised pipelines.\n2. Loss selection matters. Adding the IoU term lifts Instance IoU by +0.155\n(0.381 → 0.536) and Instance F1 by +0.309, while halving the number of false\npositives.",
