SSDD, first released in 2017\nand is considered the first large open dataset for SAR ship detection and has\nbeen used by nearly half of published studies in this area [21, 22]. It contains\nSAR images with annotated ship bounding boxes. An official improved release\nof SSDD provides standardized training/test splits and annotations (including\noriented boxes and segmentation masks) to enable fair comparisons [21, 22]. The\npopularity of SSDD has spurred the creation of other SAR datasets: HRSID\n(High-Resolution SAR Images Dataset) includes 5,604 SAR image patches and\nover 16,000 ship instances, focusing on high-resolution and even small ships [48].\nLS-SSDD-v1.0 [49] is a large-scale expansion of SSDD with Sentinel-1 imagery\ntargeting small vessels in big scenes. Additionally, datasets like AIR-SARShip\n(versions 1.0 and 2.0) [50, 51] provide SAR imagery with ships, some focusing\non airborne SAR. These SAR datasets allow algorithms to be benchmark under\ndifferent conditions (e.g., varying resolutions, clutter environments). They typi-\ncally provide ground truth in the form of bounding boxes (horizontal or rotated).\nEvaluation on SAR benchmarks often considers false alarm rate in addition to\nprecision/recall, since an important metric for radar surveillance is how many\nfalse detections occur per image or per area, given a detection threshold.\n• Optical Satellite Datasets: In the optical domain, early datasets were relatively\nsmall. ShipsNet (from Kaggle’s “Ships in Satellite Imagery”) [52] is one exam-\nple: it contains 4,000 80x80 RGB images labeled with either a “ship” or “no-ship”\nclassification. A far larger contribution came from the Airbus Ship Detection\nChallenge (2018) [53], which released a dataset of ∼40,000 satellite images\n(from Airbus SPOT 6/7 at 1.5m resolution) with segmentation masks for ships.\nThis dataset (often just called the “Airbus ship dataset”) has been widely used\nto develop and evaluate segmentation-based detectors [7, 11]. Following this,\nresearchers built more specialized datasets. MASATI (Maritime Satellite\nImagery) [54, 55] is a dataset of 7,389 satellite images labeled according to\nthe following seven classes: land, coast, sea, ship, multi, coast-ship, and detail.\nHRSC2016 and VHRShips are high-resolution aerial/satellite image datasets\nfor ship detection/classification [56] - they include many ship types and oriented\nbounding box annotations, though they often include harbor scenes which are\neasier (ships large and well-separated from background). A recent dataset called\nShipRSImageNet [57] compiles 3,435 satellite images from various sensors and\nlocations, with around 17,000 ship instances in 50 categories, aiming for diversity\n(it’s been touted as one of the largest ship detection datasets before 2024).\n• Integrated and New Datasets: The field has seen a trend toward larger and more\ncomprehensive benchmarks. Notably, UOW-Vessel[56] is a benchmark of high-\nresolution optical satellite images explicitly for vessel detection and segmen-\ntation. It consists of 3,500 large images collected from 14 countries, with 35,598\nvessel instances in 10 categories (e.g., cargo ship, tanker, fishing boat, etc.).\nUniquely UOW-Vessel provides precise polygon annotations for each ship (rather\nthan just bounding boxes), enabling evaluation of instance segmentation - a more\nfine-grained detection task relevant for identifying ship outlines [56]. This dataset\nis currently the largest of its kind in the optical domain and allows researchers\nto test algorithms on a variety of conditions worldwide. Apart from standalone",
