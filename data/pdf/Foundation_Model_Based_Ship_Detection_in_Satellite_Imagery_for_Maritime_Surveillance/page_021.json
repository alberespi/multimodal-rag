It enables monitoring of vast ocean areas to safeguard ship-\nping routes and detect illicit activities such as illegal fishing, smuggling or piracy [6].\nTraditionally, surveillance relied on human operators or shipborne radar, but these\nmethods are labor-intensive and limited in coverage. Advances in Earth observation\nnow provide frequent high-resolution images (optical and synthetic aperture radar)\nthat can be analyzed automatically. However, developing autonomous vessel detection\nsystems remains challenging. Vessels are often small objects in large scene, with high\nvariability in appearance (different sizes, shapes and sensor signatures) and they often\nappear against complex backgrounds (glinting waves, coastlines) [7]. Environmental\nvariability - such as changing lightning, sea state, weather and sensor conditions - can\nsignificantly affect detection performance. For example, waves or sea clutter can cause\nfalse alarms and clouds or darkness can obscure optical imagery. Another challenge\nis data requirements: high performing deep learning models typically need extensive\nannotated datasets, yet labeling satellite images (marking each vessel with a bound-\ning box or mask) is time-consuming and expensive [7]. This leads to limited publicly\nlabeled data for training, especially for rare classes or new sensors. Computational\nefficiency is also a concern, as processing large satellite images or continuous image\nstreams in near real-time requires optimized algorithms and hardware. An ideal vessel\ndetection system must balance accuracy and speed, processing gigapixel-scale imagery\nquickly while minimizing false detections.\nIn this context, Foundation Models have emerged as a promising solution to mit-\nigate some challenges. Foundation models are large-scale neural networks pre-trained\non broad data (often through self-supervised or unsupervised learning) that can be\nadapted to many tasks [8]. In computer vision, this includes models like large Con-\nvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers pre-trained on millions of\nimages. Their relevance to vessel detection lies in reducing dependency on labeled data:\nby learning general visual features from vast unlabeled image corpora, foundation mod-\nels provide rich representations that can be fine-tuned for ship detection with relatively\nfew labeled examples [8]. Techniques such as contrastive learning and masked image\nmodeling have been shown to significantly improve model robustness and performance\non remote sensing tasks (including object detection) by leveraging unlabeled data [8].\nThese pre-trained representations capture high-level features (like object shape or tex-\nture) that help discriminative vessels from background even under varied conditions.\nIn essence, foundation models offer a form of unsupervised knowledge transfer, which\n5",
