EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS\nreconstructions preserve sharper edges and more accurate spectral detail than those\nproduced under BCELoss.\n4.1.3 Qualitative Reconstruction Examples\nFigure 4.3 compare reconstructions produced by the self-supervised model when trained\nwith BCELoss (a) and with the superior MSELoss (b-d). Each montage is arranged\nin three columns: left – masked input patch, center – ground-truth patch, right –\nmodel reconstruction.\n• Panel a (BCELoss). Reconstructions are over-smoothed and color-shifted;\nhigh-frequency details such as wakes or coastal edges disappear, illustrating the\nlimited capacity obtained with a binary-oriented loss.\n• Panel b (MSELoss - sea & coastline). Row 1 and Row 5 depict coastal\nfragments; the shoreline geometry and tonal contrast are restored with good fi-\ndelity. Rows 2–4 correspond to open-sea patches with subtle texture; the model\npreserves color gradients and avoids artifacts, in stark contrast to the BCE out-\nput.\n• Panel c (MSELoss - sea & vessel). Row 1 shows a small, bright vessel in\ndark water: the hull and its glint are reconstructed despite heavy masking. Rows\n2–5 are homogeneous sea-surface examples illustrating how the model recovers\nlow-contrast wave patterns while maintaining correct spectral tone.\n• Panel d (MSELoss - urban patterns & mixed scenes) . Row 1 is open\nsea (reference). Row 2 includes faint ship wakes on deep water. Row 3 contains\na regular grid of coastal buildings; the diamond-shaped roof pattern re-emerges\nclearly, demonstrating the model’s ability to reconstruct fine man-made structure.\nRow 4 shows a bright coastal road network and surf line, both reconstructed\nsharply. Row 5 returns to open water with accurate color consistency.\nThese visual results corroborate the three-orders-of-magnitude quantitative gap re-\nported in Section 4.1.2: the model trained with MSELoss reliably restores both spatial\ndetail and spectral fidelity across diverse scenes (open ocean, vessels, coastline, and\nurban infrastructure), whereas the BCE model remains noticeably blurred and color-\nbiased.\n4.2 Fine-Tuning for Ship Detection\nThe previous section demonstrated that self-supervised pre-training with MSELoss\nyields a rich feature encoder. This section focuses on how this encoder is adapted to the\ndownstream task of ship detection. Fine-tuning is performed on the 280 PlanetScope\npatches that contain labeled vessels ( ≈ 4.6M water pixels and ≈ 5k vessel pixels).\nSeveral loss functions were explored, but BCE IoU Loss—an additive combination of\nbinary–cross-entropy with logits and soft IoU regularization—delivered the best balance\nbetween pixel-wise accuracy and instance-wise IoU; therefore, the description below\ncenters on that configuration, with an ablation table in Section 4.2.3 summarizing all\nvariants.",
