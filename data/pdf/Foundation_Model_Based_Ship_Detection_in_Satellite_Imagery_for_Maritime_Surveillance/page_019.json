REPORT STRUCTURE 3\nadditional samples when required, contributing to the labeling protocol used for\nsupervised learning.\n• Unsupervised Training of the Foundation Model: Train the model on\nunlabeled data to learn generalized visual representations and evaluate the quality\nif the learned features using intrinsic metrics and exploratory analysis.\n• Supervised Fine-Tuning for Detection Tasks: Fine-tune the pretrained\nmodel to detect vessels using a small set of labeled images and evaluate the\nmodel performance quantitatively and qualitatively using standard object detec-\ntion metrics (e.g., precision, recall, confusion matrix, IoU).\nThis objective are aligned with the overall vision of building a flexible, data-efficient\nmaritime monitoring system leveraging the capabilities of foundation models.\n1.3 Report structure\nThis document is structured as follows:\n• chapter 1Introduction: Presents the background and motivation for the project,\ndefines its objectives and outlines the report structure.\n• chapter 2 Related Work: Summarizes the evolution of ship detection methods\nin satellite imagery, with emphasis on the recent and state-of-the-art of founda-\ntion models and their applications in remote sensing.\n• chapter 3 Materials and Methods: Describes the data preparation, unsuper-\nvised training procedure, model architecture and fine-tuning strategy used to\nadapt the foundation model for maritime object detection.\n• chapter 4 Experimental Setup and Results: Details the dataset used, exper-\nimental configurations, evaluation metrics and performance results, followed by\nan analysis of the model’s behavior.\n• chapter 5 Discussion and Evaluation: Discusses the main findings, limita-\ntions and implications of the work, with attention to model generalization, data\nefficiency and operational integration.\n• chapter 6 Conclusions and Future Work: Concludes the report with a sum-\nmary of contributions and outlines directions for future research and system de-\nvelopment.",
