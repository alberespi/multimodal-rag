In summary,\nexisting approaches range from simple thresholding techniques to complex deep learn-\ning and foundation model strategies, with a clear trend toward leveraging pre-trained\nknowledge and unsupervised learning to improve vessel detection performance.\nThe evolution of vessel detection techniques reflects a trade-off between efficiency,\naccuracy, and adaptability. Traditional methods, such as CFAR-based detectors, are\ncomputationally efficient but struggle with false alarms in cluttered maritime environ-\nments. Deep learning approaches, including YOLO and Faster R-CNN, significantly\nenhance detection accuracy but require large-scale labeled datasets and high compu-\ntational resources. In contrast, foundation models leverage self-supervised learning to\nextract rich representations from unlabeled satellite data, enabling few-shot learning\nand better generalization across different imaging conditions. However, their deploy-\nment is constrained by high pre-training costs and large memory footprints. Table 2.1\nsummarizes the key strengths and limitations of these approaches, highlighting their\nrespective roles in modern vessel detection systems.\nApproach Strengths Limitations\nTraditional\nMethods (CFAR,\nthresholding)\nFast, no training data re-\nquired\nPoor accuracy in cluttered\nscenes, high false alarms\nDeep Learning\n(YOLO, Faster\nR-CNN)\nHigh precision, robust to\nnoise\nRequires labeled data,\ncomputationally expensive\nFoundation\nModels (Self-\nsupervised, con-\ntrastive learning)\nFewer labeled samples\nneeded, strong generaliza-\ntion\nHigh pre-training cost,\nlarge memory footprint\nTable 2.1: Summary of strengths an limitations of current existing approaches.\n2.2 Comparative Analysis\nTo understand the state-of-the-art, it is useful to compare key detection techniques\nacross several criteria: detection accuracy, computational efficiency, general-\nization, adaptability and scalability/deployment. Table 2.2 provides a high-level\ncomparison of representative approaches. The discussion of these aspects are here\nbelow:\nâ€¢ Detection Accuracy: Modern deep learning models offer the highest accuracy\nfor vessel detection. One-stage detectors like YOLOv5 and two-stage detectors\nlike Faster R-CNN can achieve high precision and recall on benchmark datasets\n(often exceeding 90% precision/recall in favorable conditions) [7, 36, 11, 37, 38,\n39]. For example, a tailored YOLOv5 variant reached 94.7% precision on a stan-\ndard SAR ship dataset [36]. By contrast, traditional methods have moderate",
