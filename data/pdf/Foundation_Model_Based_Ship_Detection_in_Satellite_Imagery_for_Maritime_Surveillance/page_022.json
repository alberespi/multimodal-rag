The following sections provide an overview of the state-of-\nthe-art in satellite-based vessel detection, highlighting existing approaches, the role of\nfoundation models and the comparative merits of different techniques.\n2.1 Existing Approaches\n2.1.1 Traditional Computer Vision Methods\nEarly and classical approaches for ship detection in satellite images relied on hand-\ncrafted features and statistical modeling of the imagery. In synthetic aperture radar\n(SAR) images, a common method is the Constant False Alarm Rate ( CFAR) detec-\ntor [9]. CFAR techniques statistically model the sea clutter background and set an\nadaptive threshold so that only bright targets (e.g., ships) standing out from the back-\nground are flagged. Variants of CFAR (such as cell-averaging CFAR or more advanced\ndistributions like Gamma models) were widely used in operational SAT systems due to\ntheir simplicity and speed [10]. Similarly, in optical imagery, classical methods included\nthresholding or edge detection after isolating the ocean region (for instance, using color\nindices to separate water), followed by morphological operations to identify ship-like\nblobs. Other approaches used hand-crafted features (e.g., Histogram of Oriented Gra-\ndients or texture descriptors) combined with classifiers to detect ships in sliding-window\nfashion. These traditional methods are efficient and require no training data, but they\noften struggle with complex scenarios. Sea clutter, sunlight or coastal structures can\ntrigger false detections and small or low-contrast vessels are easily missed. Moreover,\nfixed decision rules lack adaptability - a CFAR tuned for one sea state may fail in\nanother. Studies have noted that conventional CFAR detectors can suffer from model\nmismatch and low detection rates for small ships in rough conditions [9]. In summary,\nwhile classical approaches laid the groundwork for automated ship spotting, their ac-\ncuracy in diverse environments is limited, motivating the shift toward learning-based\nmethods.\n2.1.2 Deep Learning-Based Detection\nIn the past decade, deep learning has revolutionized object detection in remote sensing,\nincluding vessel detection. Modern state-of-the-art methods predominantly use deep\nneural networks trained on labeled examples to localize ships in images. Two major\nparadigms are common: two-stage detectors and one-stage detectors [7]. Two\nstage detectors as Faster R-CNN first generate region proposals and then classify them\nas ship or background. These models tend to be very accurate due to their refined, two-\nstep nature, but can be slower in processing large images. One-stage detectors such as\nSingle Shot Detector (SSD) and YOLO (You Only Look Once) treat detection as a\ndirect regression problem, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single\nnetwork pass [7]. They are generally faster (real-time in some cases) and have become\npopular for practical maritime surveillance where speed is important. Numerous deep\narchitectures have been explored for vessel detection. For example, the YOLO family\n(v3, v4, v5, etc.) has been applied to satellite imagery with great success [7]. One\nstudy applied YOLOv3, YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 to Airbus’s large satellite ship dataset\nand a Shipsnet dataset, achieving high precision (∼94.7% on a SAR ship test set) after",
